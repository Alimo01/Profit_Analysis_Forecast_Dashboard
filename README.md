# Profit_Analysis_Forecast_Dashboard

In my role as a Data Science consultant with 10Alytics, I had the amazing chance to spearhead a project that culminated in the creation of a dynamic Sales Performance Dashboard using Tableau.

# Sales Performance Analysis

## Monthly Profit Analysis through Trend Examination

Our journey began with a deep dive into monthly profits, unveiling intriguing patterns. In June 2015, the company faced challenges with a loss of -N8,691. Fast forward to June 2016, and the tides turned as we celebrated the highest profit ever recorded at an impressive N357,550.

## Statewise Profit Analysis using a Map

Geographical insights are priceless. Lagos State emerged as the profit hub, topping the charts at N393,050, closely trailed by Abuja at N328,956. However, challenges were evident in Zamfara, Kebbi, Osun, and Rivers, where the company faced losses. Grasping regional dynamics is pivotal for strategic decision-making.

## Weekly Projections

Our dashboard's crystal ball allowed us to foresee the future, unfortunately revealing a profit decline from July 31, 2016. The situation escalated into losses from August 14, 2016. Armed with this foresight, the company can proactively tackle challenges and navigate towards profitability.

## Weekly Projections on Product Categories

Delving deeper, we scrutinized profit trends across three product categories—Accessories, Clothing, and Phones.

- **Accessories:** Brace for a notable profit decrease from July 31, 2016, to October 16, 2016.
- **Clothing:** Anticipate a slight dip in profit during the same period.
- **Phones:** The positive news – a gradual profit increase from July 31, 2016, to October 16, 2016.

## Strategic Business Recommendations

Derived from the comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard analysis, here are strategic business suggestions to enhance profitability and overall performance:

1. **Optimize Product Mix:**
   - Seize the rising trend in the Phones category.
   - Evaluate the Accessories category to identify reasons behind the sharp profit decrease.

2. **Regional Focus:**

   - Conduct market research for regions facing losses (Zamfara, Kebbi, Osun, and Rivers).

3. **Trend Analysis for Early Intervention:**

4. **Diversification and Innovation:**
